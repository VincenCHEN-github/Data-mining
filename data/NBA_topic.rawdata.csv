 https://t.co/T0fRTFSqqq"
"127621686","DPThePremier11",2020-12-06 23:46:15,"Again, ignore the drama for a sec... I am hyped as hell for the #Rockets this season. I cannot wait for this next #NBA season in 🤘-Town! https://t.co/9eon3EcXAy"
"127621686","DPThePremier11",2020-12-07 22:19:39,"I'm really over the crap and mess right now... Throw Wood in this pic and I'm feeling hyped, excited and ready to go for this next #NBA season. Definitely some positivity here with this pic &amp; seeing some goodness in 🤘-Town. #Rockets https://t.co/dRD51jPCjy"
"127621686","DPThePremier11",2020-12-08 16:46:32,"Tilman said the Paul contract was the ""worst he had ever seen""... Granted, I don't think Paul should have taken the super huge max, but it's the #NBA, players want rings &amp; their money, it was inevitable. I think this just shows how much the #Rockets REALLY catered to Harden. https://t.co/Ra2gmVjhe5"
"127621686","DPThePremier11",2020-12-04 16:17:22,"While the #NBA return still feels a bit early IMO, I'd be lying if I didn't say I'm hyped for the season. Excited for a #Bulls restart in CHI, but I'm way more excited for the #Rockets. Perhaps a bit premature w/Harden still in the pic, but, as of now, very hyped for these guys. https://t.co/12G7AdLlOz"
"127621686","DPThePremier11",2020-12-09 01:08:57,"I disagree entirely. I never really understood why a coat and/or full suit was a regular for #NBA coaches. Any type of job where potential consistent movement (or yelling) is made should never require a sports coat/suit. I expect much more animation from coaches &amp; some comedy. https://t.co/trqBcaL8su"
"127621686","DPThePremier11",2020-12-09 01:12:16,"Also, to add to this, I also hated wearing a suit when I interned in the #NBA. I'd be at games, walking around the entire arena, &amp; some games I'd be sweating my ass off. Sports should be an anamoly in that it's an ACTIVE business, suits should never be mandatory in such aspects. https://t.co/trqBcaL8su"
"127621686","DPThePremier11",2020-12-09 01:22:31,"Damn, man, did other #Rockets fans get the @FOXSports email with this Insider article?... I love Harden to death as my favorite #NBA player, but it's not wrong to think this article is pretty fitting.

"127621686","DPThePremier11",2020-12-09 00:08:11,"I don't give a rat's ass what actually happens this #NBA season or any team records, with the way Coach Silas has handled this entire ordeal &amp; what he states during his media calls, he needs to be the Coach of the Year. Tough spot, but man, he's handled it so well. #Rockets"
"127621686","DPThePremier11",2020-12-07 19:49:00,"This is the most random question to ask the head coach of the Brooklyn Nets. Although there is the topic of Harden to BK, that serves absolutely 0 relevance to this question being asked to Nash. This is typical media hype BS from #NBA ""reporters"" that want click-bait over news. https://t.co/FDe98ZltFm"
