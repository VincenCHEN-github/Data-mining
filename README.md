We select the content of Twitter data for analysis from three perspectives. First, from the perspective of the stars, we selected James&#39; Twitter for data crawling, mainly personal dynamics and information. On the other hand, we get the tweets in the #NBA tag topic. Special content analysis text, mainly event information, game discussion, etc. Finally, we obtained official NBA accounts from 9 different countries to observe the discussion content and timeline.

**4. Conclusion**

First of all, NBA social media marketing consists of a combination of personal accounts and official accounts. Both the star personal accounts and the NBA official accounts have increased significantly. In the past few decades, the NBA has accumulated a more diversified fan base, changed the league&#39;s traditional game viewing mode, and began to move from live games and live TV to digital media channels, the most prominent of which is Twitter. Twitter has become the center of basketball fans.

The star&#39;s Twitter account focuses on information related to personal image, while the content of the official account is mostly to provide a discussion platform, which is conducive to content aggregation and expansion of influence. It is also more emotionally diverse, with no obvious emotional bias. It is like a central nervous system on which people from every corner of the world are sharing data analysis, highlights, jokes, condemnation and crazy talk. The NBA Twitter ecosystem includes professional gamblers, math geniuses, journalists, decision-making experts, die-hard fans, team public relations, rappers, government officials, many sportswear brands, cable news hosts, and current hot players.

And various organic and reply content to promote the interaction of fans can allow viewers to participate in sports events through social media in addition to watching football matches through Twitter, and other social media tools. And this NBA social media strategy is precisely the perfect business strategy.

The data we involved in this study are relatively scattered, and the variables studied are not very comprehensive. In future research, you can focus on the content of several Twitter accounts, compare them with the same variables and indicators, and use more intuitive visual images to divide and compare, and draw useful conclusions.
